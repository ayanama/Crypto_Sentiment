# Crypto_Sentiment

In this analysis, I built Named Entity Recognition models for both Bitcoin and Etherium. These were used to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin. In order to do this, I used NLTK and Python, and pulled the articles for analysis from newsapi. I also generated a Word Cloud to summarize the news for each coin.
